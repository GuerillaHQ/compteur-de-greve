# Compteur de grève

This project had as goal to offer an independent platform to count the partitipation during the French strike of March 7th of 2023, against Macron's pension reform (destruction).

We designed this website in a weekend and coded it in a night, so please be indulgent with the result. We did the best in the time we had to make it as accessible as possible. The result isn't as perfect as we would have wished. But heh, days only have 24 hours.
